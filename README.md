# Enhancing Digital Efficiency: Transformative Handwritten Digit Recognition Solution

In the Handwritten Digit Recognition Project, we developed a sophisticated Proof of Concept (POC) leveraging machine learning techniques to address challenges in manual data processing. The project not only proved the efficacy of these technologies in accurate digit recognition but also demonstrated their potential for seamless integration into existing systems, ensuring scalability, compliance, and operational efficiency improvements.

Developed a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate the capability of digit recognition using the MNIST Dataset. The following steps were undertaken to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the recognition process:

1. Employed Min-max normalization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for efficient feature reduction and computation.
1. Utilized Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gaussian Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers to achieve high-accuracy digit recognition.
1. Performed t-SNE dimensionality reduction to visualize and compare the original test data with the predicted test data.
Using a standard KNN approach, I achieved an impressive accuracy of 97.17%, showcasing its strong predictive capabilities in its basic form. I also experimented with KNN in conjunction with PCA, which slightly improved accuracy to 97.43%, demonstrating that dimensionality reduction can enhance performance.

Furthermore, achieved strong generalization and predictive capabilities using a simple yet powerful Gaussian Bayes model, with an accuracy rate of 96.36%.
